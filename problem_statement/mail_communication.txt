Dear Narendra Ravuri,

Thanks for your interest in the Senior Python Developer position at B2BHolidays! We're impressed with your application and would like to invite you to a coding assessment to further explore your skills.

We've prepared a challenging (but fun!) task that simulates a real-world scenario you might encounter in this role. You'll be working with XML and JSON data, applying business logic, and making sure everything runs smoothly.

You'll find the details in the attached PDF. It includes a clear description of what needs to be done, sample request and response data, and a few guidelines to help you along the way.

A couple of things to keep in mind:
Time frame: Aim to send us your solution within 4 days of receiving this email.
Don't forget: Include `__define_ocg__` in a comment and use the variable `var_ocg` somewhere in your code (it's our little secret handshake ðŸ˜‰).
Think like a Senior Dev: We'll be looking for clean, well-documented code that demonstrates your understanding of best practices and problem-solving skills.

We're genuinely excited to see what you come up with! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
